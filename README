channelRANS
===========

RANS Channel flow solver for OpenFOAM, with mass flow rate based pressure gradient correction.

User can define mass flow rate through a bulk velocity "Ubar" in the constant/transportProperties file.
See transportProperties file in the directory for example. Everything else is same as channel395 tutorial
in OpenFOAM 2.1.x - Just use RANS properties instead of LES.

Note: This code has NOT been rigorously tested for simulation statistics (yet..) but the trial runs were fine.
